# building-mortgage-calculator
Hi, I'm new and writing a blog where people would put the numbers and it would calculate for them. is it possible to put my this code on Word Press? how can I post this to my blog? I assume the little calulator has to go into a box or something?
num1 = input("Enter loan amount: ")
num2 = input("points: ")
num3 = float(num2) / 100
result = float(num1) * float (num3)

print(result)
